# 2026-02-17 Triage Log

Several pull requests introduced (usually very small) regressions across the board this week. On the
other hand, [#151380](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/151380) provided a nice performance win in the inference engine.
I would also like to bring attention to [#152375](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/152375),
which improved the parallel frontend. It is not shown in this report, because we don't yet have
many benchmarks for the parallel frontend, but this PR seemingly improved the `check` (wall-time)
performance with multiple frontend threads on several real-world crates by 5-10%!
